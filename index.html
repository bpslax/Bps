            <h2>Introduction of BPS</h2>
            <p>
                The founders of Bhartiya Shikshan Sansthan, with a zeal and a visionary outlook, have demonstrated that anything worthwhile can be achieved through sincerity of purpose, right execution, and implementation. Within a relatively short span of time, Bhartiya Shikshan Sansthan is today counted as one of the best institutions in Rajasthan. Bhartiya Shikshan Sansthan is committed to providing world-class academics, infrastructure, and a highly disciplined atmosphere.

            <h2>Founder of BPS</h2>
            <p>
                Name of the founder: Ramswaroop Mahala
                The Vidyalaya is situated in peaceful and pollution-free lap of nature in the area of Manasiya Road, Laxmangarh, Sikar (Raj.). The Vidyalaya runs in a magnificent triple-storeyed building with well-furnished big classrooms. It is rightly said, "Success rarely comes from making just a few big efforts. Success almost always is the result of small multiplied again and again". Our aim in education is to develop several distinct dimensions in which our students must equip themselves. These dimensions - physical, intellectual, patriotism, and spiritual - distinguish them from others and make them committed to the task of safeguarding this great nation of ours founded on twin ideals of secularism and democracy.

                BPS Convent School is opened with the ideology to nourish and nurture the potential of individuals to the extent of perfection. Here we endeavor to spread the light of education all around.

BPS Convent School provides a stimulating and enriched environment with the best-in-class infrastructure for learning through Smart Classes, well-equipped labs, Class Room Teaching, and Co-curricular activities.
